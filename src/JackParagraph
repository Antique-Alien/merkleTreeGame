Jack Price:

The most challenging part of the code for me was the integrating of different people's code. Although Intellij helped, finding all the small differences in the naming conventions was difficult. Also, the understanding of other peopleâ€™s code was hard. I have now seen why comments are extremely important. They help people work together, which is intrinsically very hard. However, all in all, this was a very fun lab.
